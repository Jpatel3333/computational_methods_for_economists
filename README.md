## Computational Methods for Economists
An introduction to Python programming and algorithmic economics.  

This course is divided into three learning sections and three economics projects.  The three learning sections are:
1. Basic Python Coding: This section introduces you to the basic procedural programming concepts used in Python, using Jupyter Lab and command line programs. You will also be introduced to the application of agent-based algorithms to microeconomic systems.   
2. Intermediate Python Developer: This section introduces you to more advanced ways to organize and think about code using Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming in Python.  You will also be introduced to more advanced tools like Visual Studio Code, and git and GitHub.
3. Scientific Programming:  This section will introduce you to the main scientific libraries used in Python including SciPy, NumPy, matplotlib, Pandas, SymPy, and statsmodels.    

The three economics projects are:
1. Economics of Risk:  This projects develops a library of modules to study and apply risk preferences. 
2. Decision Trees and the Economics of Search: This project develops a library of modules to represent decision problems as decision trees and to apply decision trees to the economics of search.
3. Markets Project:  This project develops a library to study price discovery and the allocation of resources in two-sided markets.
